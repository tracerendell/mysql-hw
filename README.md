week 12 homework

THis is my mysql homework!  I was only able to complete challenge #1

Please see my attached screen shots, as i did not have the brain energy to learn how to make gifs.

my application first displays a table of the current bamazon inventory then asks if you would like to purchase anything

if you say no, than it will wish you a nice day.  if you say yes you will then be prompted to select something from the inventory....

then to select a quantity....

if the item is in stock, it will let you know...

then it will give you your total cost, and wish you a great day!

if the quantity you order is more than what is in stock....

the app will appologize for being out of stock and ask you to adjust your order...

the prompt will start over at "what would you like to purchase".

from there the app functions as normal.
